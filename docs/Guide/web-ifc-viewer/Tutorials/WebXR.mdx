  web-ifc-viewer has been extended to enable WebXR, but you can also easily create your own customized solution via web-ifc-three <a href="https://github.com/IFCjs/hello-world/tree/main/examples/web-ifc-three/webxr">example here</a>.

## Introduction

WebXR brings VR and AR to teh web and gives more immersive experiences. The screen is replaces with a VR headset and the mouse with one or more controllers, and web-ifc-viewer can provide some base functionalities out of the box.

## How to do it

### Set Initialization Options to include webXR

This is easily done by setting the property `webXR` to true on initializing the viewer:
```javascript
const container = document.getElementById('viewer-container');
const viewer = new IfcViewerAPI({ container, webXR: true });
```

## The result

ðŸ˜Ž That alone gives us the web-ifc-viewer WebXR enabled and with controller functionality including movement via controller1 `squeeze` and component highlighting via controler2 `select`.
You can customize the behavior you want from the VR controllers by modifying the `vrControllers.ts` file at `web-ifc-viewer/viewer/src/components/context/vrControllers.ts`.

    Having a VR headset is not required to develop for WebXR. ðŸ”Œ You can simulate a VR headset using tools such as <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/webxr-api-emulator/mjddjgeghkdijejnciaefnkjmkafnnje?hl=en">this Chrome plugin</a> to test your work.
